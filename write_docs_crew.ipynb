      "## Why CrewAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer.\n",
      "CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.12 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, install CrewAI:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "pip install crewai\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
      "```\n",
      "The command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "crewai create crew <project_name>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "my_project/\n",
      "├── .gitignore\n",
      "├── pyproject.toml\n",

      "## Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n",
      "\n",
      "CrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How CrewAI Compares\n",
      "\n",
      "**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Autogen**: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **ChatDev**: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n",

      "It's pivotal to understand that **NO data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned. When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.\n",

      "## Why CrewAI?\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of AI collaboration has too much to offer.\n",
      "CrewAI is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit - much like a well-oiled crew. Whether you're building a smart assistant platform, an automated customer service ensemble, or a multi-agent research team, CrewAI provides the backbone for sophisticated multi-agent interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.12 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, install CrewAI:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "pip install crewai\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to install the 'crewai' package along with its optional features that include additional tools for agents, you can do so by using the following command:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "pip install 'crewai[tools]'\n",
      "```\n",
      "The command above installs the basic package and also adds extra components which require more dependencies to function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI (Command Line Interface) command:\n",
      "\n",
      "```shell\n",
      "crewai create crew <project_name>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "my_project/\n",
      "├── .gitignore\n",
      "├── pyproject.toml\n",

      "            └── tasks.yaml\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "You can now start developing your crew by editing the files in the `src/my_project` folder. The `main.py` file is the entry point of the project, the `crew.py` file is where you define your crew, the `agents.yaml` file is where you define your agents, and the `tasks.yaml` file is where you define your tasks.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Flexible Task Management**: Define tasks with customizable tools and assign them to agents dynamically.\n",
      "- **Processes Driven**: Currently only supports `sequential` task execution and `hierarchical` processes, but more complex processes like consensual and autonomous are being worked on.\n",
      "- **Save output as file**: Save the output of individual tasks as a file, so you can use it later.\n",
      "- **Parse output as Pydantic or Json**: Parse the output of individual tasks as a Pydantic model or as a Json if you want to.\n",
      "- **Works with Open Source Models**: Run your crew using Open AI or open source models refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring your agents' connections to models, even ones running locally!\n",

      "## Connecting Your Crew to a Model\n",
      "\n",
      "CrewAI supports using various LLMs through a variety of connection options. By default your agents will use the OpenAI API when querying the model. However, there are several other ways to allow your agents to connect to models. For example, you can configure your agents to use a local model via the Ollama tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please refer to the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page for details on configuring you agents' connections to models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How CrewAI Compares\n",
      "\n",
      "**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI is built with production in mind. It offers the flexibility of Autogen's conversational agents and the structured process approach of ChatDev, but without the rigidity. CrewAI's processes are designed to be dynamic and adaptable, fitting seamlessly into both development and production workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Autogen**: While Autogen does good in creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **ChatDev**: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.\n",

      "### Documentation Completeness and Accuracy\n",
      "The provided documentation is clear and well-structured, describing the process for reporting security vulnerabilities in CrewAI products or services. It includes details on how to report vulnerabilities, what information to include in the report, and the process for triaging and addressing reported issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alignment with Current Codebase\n",
      "After reviewing the codebase, I was unable to find any information related to security vulnerability reporting. This suggests a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual codebase.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Identified Discrepancies\n",
      "The main discrepancy is the lack of implementation of security vulnerability reporting in the codebase, despite being described in the documentation.\n",

      "### Missing or Outdated Sections\n",
      "The codebase appears to be missing a section or module responsible for handling security vulnerability reports. This is a significant omission, as it is an essential aspect of ensuring the security and integrity of the CrewAI products and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas Needing Updates\n",
      "To align the documentation with the codebase, the following areas need updates:\n",
      "1. **Implementation of Security Vulnerability Reporting**: The codebase needs to be updated to include a module or section that handles security vulnerability reports, as described in the documentation.\n",
      "2. **Documentation of Current Codebase**: The documentation should be updated to reflect the current state of the codebase, including any changes or omissions related to security vulnerability reporting.\n",
      "3. **Codebase Refactoring**: The codebase may require refactoring to ensure that it is secure, maintainable, and aligns with the described documentation.\n",
